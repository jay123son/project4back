    "about": "Ocean uses motifs of summer and bleached hair to portray the carefree nature of adolescence, and its eventual end. “Blonde” offers a peek into the broken souls that were never consoled, articulately weaving themes of youth, loss, and nostalgia into an instrumental mood that is hazy, heart wrenching, and genre-defying."

    "about": "The overall story of Tyler, the Creator's album, IGOR, is something many have lived through. You fall for someone. They reciprocate but refuse to go all-in. So you exist in limbo, waiting on them to bring you heaven or send you to hell. Consumed by the lack of closure: you wallow, you hurt, you rage. But. Eventually. You come to your senses and move on.

    "about": "If you peel back all the layers of SZA, you’ll find a lyricist at the core.
